## Disclamer ‚ö†Ô∏è
- We're of course not responsible for any ban you recieve for using this bot.
- Please keep an eye on the bot to solve captchas. Do not be irresponsible if you don't want to get banned.
- Please do not grind in public servers.
- Hunting and Fishing must be done in seperate servers.
- If you get "please wait" message while fishing, it is not because of this bot as the timers are fixed. This is a problem with Pokemeow itself. The bot will automatically send ";f" again if this comes.
